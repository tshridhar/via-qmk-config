# via-qmk-config
This is the VIA-QMK layout json the following builds:
- DZ60 RGB ANSI v2 HOTSWAP
- KBDFANS MKII RGB HOTSWAP
It features 3 layers:
<br/>
##### Layer 1: 
- Basic keymap with alphas and numbers, ESC. Caps Lock is FN1 on hold, normal on tap using LT() function.
- four keys at the bottom right are mapped to RALT, FN1, FN2, RCTRL (note that these may not be actual keycodes)
- Note: Holding LSHIFT with ESC gives ~, this is not intentional... to be fixed... <br/>
##### Layer 2 (incomplete):
- Anne Pro 2 layer 1 layout. WASD are arrow keys, IJKL are arrow keys, 
- \[ is mapped to HOME, \] is mapped to END
- ; is mapped to PGUP, ' is mapped to PGDWN
- / is mapped to DEL <br/>
- RCTRL is mapped to Media NEXT
- FN2 is mapped to Media PREV
##### Layer 3 (incomplete):
- WIP, but will have all RGB controls

### Background
Used an Anne Pro 2 as my daily driver for about 2 years and absolutely loved keytap layout and layers. Decided to make a custom build and apply the same layout.



#### Issues

- Screenshot of first FN layer is incorrect, does not reflect changes in the latest version
